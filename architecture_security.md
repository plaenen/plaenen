Userbase is the easiest way to create secure and private web applications. Userbase offers built-in user accounts and authentication, an end-to-end encrypted zero-management database and file storage solution, and a way to accept subscription payments. All Userbase features are accessible through a very simple open source Javascript SDK, directly from the browser. No backend necessary - Userbase manages the backend for you, and no one with access to the Userbase backend can access your users’ data.

This document describes Userbase’s design roughly following the 4+1 architectural view model.
